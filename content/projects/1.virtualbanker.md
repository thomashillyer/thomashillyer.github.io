# RBC Virtual Banker

This project was a collaboration between RBC and our team, students at McGill University. The goal was to create a virtual assistant that could help customers with their banking needs. The project was completed over 8 months with a team of 4 students.

We used neural networks to make budgeting suggestions based on the financial transaction history of the logged in user.

The product was a mobile app written in Kotlin (Java) for Android. 

RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) is the largest bank in Canada and after we presented our finished product they leveraged the student research and financial lessons we created to launch a [new personal finance course in collaboration with McGill University](https://mcgillpersonalfinance.com/).
