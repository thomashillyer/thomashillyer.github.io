# Starting a new website

It's been long overdue that I have anything on this website other than either links to my LinkedIn and Github or a pseudo resume (that was a while ago).

## Purpose

There isn't really going to be a focus here other than showcasing my work. I wanted to set up somewhere where I can jot down ideas in short form without feeling any pressure to stick to a schedule or format.

There might be some pages about my current work renovating my house myself, interesting tech I come across, and poorly fleshed out ideas among others.

My house renovation can encompass anything from building new kitchen cabinets, rewiring the whole house, replumbing the whole house, to adding smart features and devices to configuring the network.

So, welcome, and I hope you find something interesting!
